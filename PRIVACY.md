## User Data Sharing

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei shares limited personal information about you and/or others
strictly for the purpose of providing functionality of the bot. The data sharing
process is only done on the requirement of the bot operations.

In order to provide various features, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei collects data from other
services as described below. Any user willing to opt-out from the service may do
so by deleting their account from the particular service stated below and/or by
removing their data from the bot.

### MyAnimeList: Global

To offer user profile lookup, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei use [Jikan API][jikan] which is a
third-party software that assists in accessing [MyAnimeList][mal] to obtain
information about the user's profile. This information is used by Ryuuzaki
Ryuusei for `/myanimelist profile` and `/verify` commands.

During `/register` command is invoked, bot will directly connect to MyAnimeList
to obtain live data by scraping user's profile page to check verification code.

### Last.FM: Global

Last.FM username is shared with the [Last.FM][lastfm] service to retrieve
information regarding the user's profile and recently played tracks. This
information is accessed by Ryuuzaki Ryuusei for `/lastfm profile` command.

Last.FM's username can be used else during provider linking to your registered
account on the bot to only obtain user ID.

### AniList: Global

Similarly to Last.FM, AniList username is shared to [AniList][al] to allow user
showcasing their profile, and will return any data that is required to render
the result when invoking `/anilist profile` command.

AniList's username can be used else during provider linking to your registered
account on the bot to only obtain user ID.

### MAL-Heatmap

to the user's histories in a visualized heatmap format. This information is used
solely for the purpose of providing data in the `/myanimelist profile` command.

### Discord: Global

user's profile and write command actor for server audit logs. The information is
used to provide the following functionality:

- `/discord profile` command
- `/utilities avatar` command
- `/utilities banner` command
- `/register` command
- `/unregister` command
- `/verify` command
- `/whoami` command

### PronounDB

Shikimori username is shared with the [Shikimori][shiki] to allow user
showcasing their profile, and will return any data that is required to render
the result when invoking `/shikimori profile` command.

Shikimori's username can be used else during provider linking to your registered
account on the bot to only obtain user ID.

## User Interaction

When you invite the Bot and grant it the "Read Message/View Channels"
permission, it will monitor and process messages from Space (Server, Group)
members. This allows the Bot to provide interactive message features. However,
participation in this feature is optional.

To opt-out, simply send `/usersettings autoembed state:Disable` to the Bot.
Server Administrators can also remove the "Read Message/View Channels"
permission by modifying the invite link's "permissions" parameter from
`274878221376` to `274878220352`. We prioritize transparency and user control,
ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and data protection principles.

## Aggregated Data Sharing

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei may share aggregated data with third parties for statistical
purposes, but no personal information will be included in the aggregated data.

Following is the list of third parties that Ryuuzaki Ryuusei may share
aggregated data with:

| Provider                | Data Shared                | Purpose           |

| [Top.gg][topgg]         | Server Count, Shards Count | Public statistics |

## Data Caching

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei stores information for the purpose of caching for limited time,
which is intended to reduce the number of requests made to supported Providers and
decrease the time it takes to retrieve information. This function only caches
information that is related to a Title and optionally limited Personal
Information, and does not transmit any information about you other than the
bot's IP address, User Agent and/or query request and responses.

Below is the table explaining retention period for each features from 3rd party

Please note that the retention periods explained above apply solely to the
Service, referring to the Ryuuzaki Ryuusei, where data caching is implemented.
These retention periods do not extend to the supported providers themselves. For
precise information about data retention policies on the supported providers, we
recommend contacting each provider directly. This ensures that users have a
comprehensive understanding of the data caching policy's scope and that any
inquiries regarding data retention are addressed appropriately

## Data Logging

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei does not log any information related to the User activity. In
situations related to development, bug fixing, and testing, however, general
information such as bot startup, command execution, API process, caches,
and errors may be logged, but these logs will only be used for debugging
purposes and will not be used for others.

## Access to User Data

Users can access their data by utilizing the `/export data` command. Once
executed, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei will generate a JSON string and preferred file format
that contains all the information that the bot has gathered about the user.

It's important to note that this data export represents a mirror of the
information that is stored in the bot. If you would like to see which data
points are being collected by Ryuuzaki Ryuusei, please refer to the
[User Data Collection and Usage](#user-data-collection-and-usage) section of
this document.

If you prefer an interactive way to check information stored in bot, `/whoami`
command is available as well.

All user data is stored in a database that is written in CSV format. This
database is only accessible by the Data Controller, and will never be shared
with third parties, evaluated, analyzed, distributed, or otherwise made
available for any reason.

Data retention is essential for the Ryuuzaki Ryuusei bot to function as
expected. Therefore, it will not be deleted unless a user explicitly requests
its removal. More information regarding data retention and user rights can be
found in the [Data Retention](#data-retention) and [User Rights](#user-rights)
sections of this document.

External services such as [AniList][al], [AnimeAPI][aniapi], [MyAnimeList][mal]
(via [Jikan][jikan]), [SIMKL][simkl], [The Movie Database][tmdb], and
[Trakt][trakt] might be used by Ryuuzaki Ryuusei to retrieve title-related
information. Please note that such services shall only receive limited
information necessary for providing you with the service you requested, and they
will not have access to your personal data.

## Data Retention

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei will keep the User's data for as long as they are registered in
the bot. If the User wishes to erase their data from the bot, they can employ
`/unregister` command to request the removal of their data.

Do note cached data during retention period can not removed until the period
itself has expired. If you wish to remove related cached immediately after
unregistration, please contact the Data Controller in the [About Us](#about-us)
section.
