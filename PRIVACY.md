## User Data Sharing

In order to provide various features, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei collects data from other
services as described below. Any user willing to opt-out from the service may do
so by deleting their account from the particular service stated below and/or by
removing their data from the bot.

### MyAnimeList: Global

To offer user profile lookup, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei use [Jikan API][jikan] which is a
third-party software that assists in accessing [MyAnimeList][mal] to obtain
information about the user's profile. This information is used by Ryuuzaki
Ryuusei for `/profile`, `/admin_register`, `/register`, and `/verify` commands.

### Last.FM

Last.FM username is shared with the [Last.FM][lastfm] service to retrieve
information regarding the user's profile and recently played tracks. This
information is accessed by Ryuuzaki Ryuusei exclusively for `/lastfm` command
purposes.

## Data Caching

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei stores information for the purpose of caching, which is
intended to reduce the number of requests made to external services and decrease
the time it takes to retrieve information. This function only caches information
that is related to a Title, and does not transmit any information about you
other than the bot's IP address and/or query request.

The data that is stored is used exclusively to enable the following
functionality:

* `/anime` commands group
* `/manga` commands group

The services used to perform data caching include:

* [AniList][al]: Title information
* [AnimeAPI][aniapi]: ID relation mapping
* [MyAnimeList][mal] (via [Jikan][jikan]): Title information
* [SIMKL][simkl]: Title information

## Data Logging

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei does not log any information related to the User. In situations
related to development, bug fixing, and testing, however, general information
such as bot startup, command execution, API process, and errors may be logged,
but these logs will only be used for debugging purposes, and will be terminated
once the bot is production-ready.

The maintenance and development of the bot are overseen by a Data Controller,
and in instances where logging is enabled, users shall be notified through
Support Server announcements and Bot Activity status.

## Access to User Data

Users can access their data by utilizing the `/export_data` command. Once
executed, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei will generate a JSON file that contains all the
information that the bot has gathered about the user.

It's important to note that this data export represents a mirror of the
information that is stored in the bot. If you would like to see which data
points are being collected by Ryuuzaki Ryuusei, please refer to the
[User Data Collection and Usage](#user-data-collection-and-usage) section of
this document.

If you prefer an interactive way to check information stored in bot, `/whois`
command is available as well.

All user data is stored in a database that is written in CSV format. This
database is only accessible by the Data Controller, and will never be shared
with third parties, evaluated, analyzed, distributed, or otherwise made
available for any reason.

Data retention is essential for the Ryuuzaki Ryuusei bot to function as
expected. Therefore, it will not be deleted unless a user explicitly requests
its removal. More information regarding data retention and user rights can be
found in the [Data Retention](#data-retention) and [User Rights](#user-rights)
sections of this document.

External services such as [AniList][al], [AnimeAPI][aniapi], [MyAnimeList][mal]
(via [Jikan][jikan]), [SIMKL][simkl], [The Movie Database][tmdb], and
[Trakt][trakt] might be used by Ryuuzaki Ryuusei to retrieve title-related
information. Please note that such services shall only receive limited
information necessary for providing you with the service you requested, and they
will not have access to your personal data.

## Data Retention

the bot. If the User wishes to erase their data from the bot, they can employ
