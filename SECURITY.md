# Ryuuzaki Ryuusei Security Notice

Greetings! I'm Sultan Iskandar Maulana, also known as Natsu Tadama, the creator
of Ryuuzaki Ryuusei Discord Bot. Thank you for your interest in contributing to
this project. Before you proceed, please carefully review the information
outlined in this notice.

## Supported Versions

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei follows a versioning system loosely based on `interactions.py`
versioning, which draws inspiration from [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
However, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei does not strictly adhere to Semantic Versioning, as it
is a rolling release software.

To provide clarity, here is a table of the currently supported versions, based
on `interactions.py` versioning, where name on bracket is the name of the
release branch:
