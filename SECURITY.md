# Ryuuzaki Ryuusei Security Notice

Greetings! I'm Sultan Iskandar Maulana, also known as Natsu Tadama, the creator
of Ryuuzaki Ryuusei Discord Bot. Thank you for your interest in contributing to
this project. Before you proceed, please carefully review the information
outlined in this notice.

## Supported Versions

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei follows a versioning system loosely based on `interactions.py`
versioning, which draws inspiration from [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
However, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei does not strictly adhere to Semantic Versioning, as it
is a rolling release software.

To provide clarity, here is a table of the currently supported versions, based
on `interactions.py` versioning, where name on bracket is the name of the
release branch:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD034 -->
| Version |   Support Status   | Notes                                                    |
| ------: | :----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------- |
|   5.5.1 | :white_check_mark: | Current release version                                  |
|   5.5.0 | :white_check_mark: | Pin `discord_typings` to `0.5.1` if you use this version |
| < 5.4.0 |         :x:        | Deprecated temporarily due to Discord image proxy bug    |
| < 4.4.0 |         :x:        | Unsupported, bot requires Python 3.10 or higher          |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Please note that the current rolling release (version 5.5.0) is under heavy
development and receives high priority for bug fixes, enhancements, and security
updates.
