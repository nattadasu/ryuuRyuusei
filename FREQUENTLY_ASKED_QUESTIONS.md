## Registration Questions

### How do I register?

You can register by typing `/register` in any text channel. This will show you
the steps to verify your account.

Once you're done, you can click/press verify button to verify your account.

### I accidentally closed the registration message, how do I open it again?

You can open the registration message by typing `/register` in any text channel.
your verification code will not change unless 12 hours has passed.

### I saw `/verify` command in help, but I can't use it, why?

`/verify` command is only available for the server which hosts Ryuuzaki Ryuusei.
You can't use it in any other servers.

`/verify` command acts to validate if you're on the MyAnimeList club of the
server it hosts, which will give you a special role.

### I don't want to register, can I still use Ryuuzaki Ryuusei?

Yes! You can still use Ryuuzaki Ryuusei without registering. However, you can't
use some commands' niche features, such as invoking `/profile` without
mentioning anyone.

### I don't want to use Ryuuzaki Ryuusei anymore, how do I delete my account?

You can delete your account by typing `/unregister` in any text channel. This
will delete your account and all of your data.

Remember, doing this action is irreversible. Once you delete your account, you
can't get it back.

Also, please note that caches are not deleted when you delete your account
before cache period ends. You can contact bot owner to delete your caches, if
any.

### I want to obtain my data saved in bot, how to get it?

You can get your data saved by bot by typing `/export data`, and you may select
preferred `file_format`, ranging from classic JSON, YAML, CSV, or even Python
Dict.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
### I have accounts from several supported platforms on Ryuusei that I want to link to my Discord account, how do I do that?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

You can link your accounts by typing `/platform link` in any text channel. This
will let you link your accounts.

To unlink your accounts, you can easily do it by typing `/platform unlink` in
any text channel.

## Anime Commands

### Why in some anime, I got an error message saying related to NSFW content?

By default, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei allows "Ecchi" titles to be previewed in non-NSFW
channels by checking individual tags and genres if they are indeed "Ecchi" or
not.

If by any chance you got an error message saying related to NSFW content, it
means that the title is might contain Hentai or other NSFW content. You can
still get the title's information on NSFW channels, though.

## Manga Commands

### Why in search results, some manga have "Possibly NSFW" label?

By default, Ryuuzaki Ryuusei allows "Ecchi" titles to be previewed in non-NSFW
channels by checking individual tags and genres if they are indeed "Ecchi" or
not.

However, in AniList, whether a title is NSFW or not is determined by the
community. So, there are some titles that are not "Ecchi" but are still tagged
as "Adult Content" by the community, just because they have small amounts of
nudity or sexual content.

The "Possibly NSFW" label is there to warn you that the title might contain
some NSFW content, but it's not guaranteed.

### Why in some manga, I got an error message saying related to NSFW content?

See [Why in some anime, I got an error message saying related to NSFW?][ani_nsfw]

[ani_nsfw]: #why-in-some-anime-i-got-an-error-message-saying-related-to-nsfw-content

### Why in "English Title" and/or "Genres and Tags" name, there's an asterisk (\*)?

On "English Title", the asterisk (\*) means that the title is not the official
English title. It's either taken from community translation or directly using
transliterated (romaji) title. This does not guarantee that the title is in
English at all, as the bot only checks if the title contains English characters
or not, which in some languages, it bypassed the test.

On "Genres and Tags", the asterisk (\*) means that some of the tags or genres
are removed to comply with some server rules. The bot will not tell you which
tags or genres are removed, but you can check it yourself by clicking the
manga's link. This only affects on non-NSFW channels.

### Why in "Genres and Tags" name, there's an exclamation mark (!)?

The exclamation mark (!) means that the tags or genres are labeled as "NSFW" by
AniList. This only affects on NSFW channels.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
### Having direct link to MyAnimeList on result is nice... BUT WHY ALSO SHIKIMORI? HECK, WHAT IS SHIKIMORI EVEN?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Shikimori is a Russian anime and manga database. Yes, it's Russian, but it's
also available in English. It's also one of the most popular anime and manga
in Russian-speaking countries.

You may wonder why it's there. It's because Shikimori media ID is **LITERALLY**
1:1 with MyAnimeList media ID. So, implementing it is not that hard.

~~also, I'd personally Shikimori is sister site of MyAnimeList, but FOSS~~

## Profile Commands, in General

### How do I mention someone's profile?

Simply type `/profile` and mention the user you want to mention on `user`
argument. You can also use their platform's `username` as the argument.

### How do I mention my own profile?

Assumes that you have registered your account and linked, you can simply type
`/profile <platform>` without mentioning anyone. This will show your own
profile.

For `/profile discord` command, registering your account is not required.

### How do I mention my own profile without typing my platform?

No, you can't. You have to type your platform.

### How to customize how much information I want to show on my profile?

You can customize the returned information by modifying `embed_layout` argument
and select the layout you want. `/profile discord` does not have this argument.

For `/profile lastfm`, you may prefer to use `maximum` argument to show how many
tracks you want to show.

### Why Minimal and Classic is... oddly similar?

Minimal and Classic layout is indeed similar, but there's a slight difference
between them. The difference is that Classic layout will show your profile
picture (and banner if any) and list status, while Minimal layout will not.

Also, Classic layout will get additional related buttons to external sites,
while in Minimal, it only shows the buttons to your profile and lists.

### DONT YOU THINK HIGHLY DETAILED LAYOUT IS TOO MUCH?

That's the purpose of it. :P

## Profile: Discord Command

### Why there's "PronounDB Pronouns" section in my profile?

This section is only available if you have registered your account on
[PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org/). This section will show your preferred
pronouns.

### What's Snowflake? '-')

Snowflake is a unique ID that is used to identify your Discord account. Snowflake
itself consists of 3 parts: timestamp, worker ID, and process ID, which are
unique to each Discord account.

## Profile: MyAnimeList

### Why my profile is not showing up?

There are several reasons why your profile is not showing up:

1. You haven't registered your account.
2. You might have registered your account, but you changed your username on
   MyAnimeList.
3. Your account is private.
4. There's unknown problem when contacting Jikan.
5. Jikan still trying to cache your data first.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
### Why there's weird grid image on my profile if I chose embed layout other than Minimal?
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Grid image you saw is a generated heatmap image provided by [MAL Heatmap][malh],
which shows you a quick glance how much titles you've consumed in a day.

To register your activity, simply heads up to [their homepage][malh] and put your
username in there.

Do note that Ryuuzaki Ryuusei's developer is not liable any damages happened
in any 3rd party sites you've linked to. You may ask the site's developer
instead for any problems related to the site or you wanted to remove your
account from the site.

## Profile: AniList

### ...why card layout uses AniList's embed card?

It's because you chose card layout?

No, seriously, it's because AniList's embed card is faster to load than the bot
trying to generate the card itself.
