      Hello and thank you for your interest to read this tl;dr version of
      Privacy Policy.


      In this message we shortly briefing which content we collect, store, and
      use, including what third party services we used for bot to function as
      expected. You can read the full version of
      [Privacy Policy here at anytime you wish](https://github.com/nattadasu/ryuuRyuusei/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).


      __We collect, store, and use following data__:

      - Discord: username, discriminator, user snowflake ID, joined date,
      guild/server ID of registration, server name, date of registration, user
      referral (if any)

      - MyAnimeList: username, user ID, joined date


      __We shared limited personal information about you to 3rd Party__:

      This is required for the bot to function as expected, with the following
      services:

      Discord, Last.FM, MAL Heatmap, MyAnimeList


      __We cached data for limited features of the bot__:

      Used to reduce the amount of API calls to 3rd party services, and to
      reduce the amount of time to process the data and no information tied to
      you.


      __We do not collect, however, following data__:

      Any logs of messages sent by system about you under any circumstances.
      Logging of messages only occurs when you invoked general commands (such as
      `/help`, `/anime`, `/manga`, etc.) and during the bot's development
      process. Maintenance will announced in the Bot status channel in Support
      Server and Bot Activity.


      Data stored locally to Data Maintainer's (read: owner) server/machine of
      this bot as CSV. To read your profile that we've collected, type
      `/export_data` following your username.
