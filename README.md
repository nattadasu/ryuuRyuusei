    <br>
</p>

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei is a Discord bot that can be used to verify MAL club members
and advanced media title lookup (anime, manga, games) staiically while it
keeping simple and easy to use, also respecting users under GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and
other privacy laws.

By inviting this bot to your server or using it, you agree to the
[Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) and [Terms of Service](TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md).

> **Warning**
>
> This bot is a rolling release bot, which means that the bot may not be stable
> and may have bugs. If you find any bugs, please report it to GitHub Issues or
> on the support server.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, invite it to your server using this link:

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/abdcfba3715242ff8d1d9de6cf98d27a)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/nattadasu/ryuuRyuusei?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=nattadasu/ryuuRyuusei&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)
[![Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite%20to%20your%20server-7289DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=811887256368840744&permissions=274878221376&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Next, go to the channel you want to use the bot in and type `/` to see the list
of available commands.

Currently the bot was self-hosted, so it's might not available 24/7, but it get
the job done. Although, I'll try to keep it online as much as possible.

All data invoked from `/register` will be stored in
[database.csv](database/database.csv), user is able to delete their data by
using `/unregister` command. Most commands can be used without `/register`
command, although it may limit your experience using it.

If you have any questions, feel free to join the
[support server](https://nttds.my.id/discord) and ask there.

## üöÄ Features <a name = "features"></a>

> This also will be our to-do list for the bot. :3

- [x] MAL account verification (only for self-hosted bot).
- [x] Privacy-friendly: no data is stored on the bot's server, except for the
      user's Discord ID and MAL username. See [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for
      more information.
- [x] Delete your data from the bot's database at any time as you wish using
      `/unregister` command.
- [x] Beautiful embed with thumbnail and footer.
- [x] Simple yet powerful anime, manga, and game lookup.
  - [x] Ability to select search result from multiple results rather than
        automatically selecting the first result. (I'm looking at you, Nadeko)
  - [x] Accurate release date, adapted to your local timezone (based on
        MyAnimeList).
  - [x] External links (MAL, AniList, AniDB, Kitsu, SIMKL, IMDb, TMDB, Trakt,
        and more).
  - [x] A lot of information about the media compared to competitors: synopsis,
        genres and themes, rating with total votes, and more!
  - [x] Know ID of the title you want to search? Use `/command info` command
        instantly!
- [x] Shows your birthday; including remaining days to your upcoming birthday
      (based on MyAnimeList user profile).
- [x] Customizable Last.fm scrobble summary.
- [x] Export your data in JSON or Python dictionary format.
- [x] Experience the *"true"* randomness result on `/anime random` and
      `/random_nekomimi` commands![^1]
- [x] Self-hosting on your phone? No problem! Bot has been tested on Termux on
      Android 11.
- [x] ~~**100% Approved by Kagamine Len**[^2]~~
- [ ] Does not support dynamic airing reminder. LiveChart + RSS bot is a good
      alternative.
- [ ] Does not support updating your list to MyAnimeList. You can use
      [White Cat](https://whitecat.app) instead.
- [ ] Currently does not support character and cast lookup as it can be really
      complicated if you're using multiple platforms.

[^1]: The random seed was generated using UUID4 and truncated to 32 bits (`pandas` couldn't able to get a sample using a seed above 32 bits unfortunately), and this seed generation happened ***everytime*** user invoked command. I can not guarantee the randomness as it is not the true random as in cryptographically secure random, but it's good enough that you should have hard time to get the same result twice in a row.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `python`, `pip`, and `git`.
- Has a Discord bot token.

### Installing

To install Ryuuzaki Ryuusei, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nattadasu/ryuuRyuusei.git
cd ryuuRyuusei
```

Next, you need to do an initial setup for the bot. Run `firstRun.py` and let the
automation intelligently pick the latest version of installed Python and
installs `jikanpy` from GitHub repository (we need APIv4 and AioJikan
support), install required modules for the bot, and finally prepare databases
(bot, `nattadasu/nekomimiDb`, and AnimeAPI).

```bash
python ./firstRun.py
```

> **Note**
>
> In some cases, you may need to add variable `PYTHON_BINARY` to skip the
> automatic Python version detection. For example in PowerShell (Windows/Core),
> if you have multiple versions of Python installed, you can use
>
> ```pwsh
> $Env:PYTHON_BINARY = "${Env:LOCALAPPDATA}/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe"
> ```
>
> to force the script to use Python 3.9.

Then, when `pip` finished installing all of required modules, copy
`.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required fields.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, run the bot using `python` command:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

> **Note**
>
> You can also use `python3` instead of `python` if you have multiple versions
> of Python installed. By default (and also `firstRun.py` behavior), the bot
> will use `python3`/`python` that is currently in your `PATH` environment
> variable.

- Karasian, for creating the verification bot for The Newbie Club Discord server
- Lacrima, YubiYuub, and Mental Illness, for helping me with the bot
- [White Cat](https://whitecat.app/), for the ability to link MAL account to
  Discord account and profile can be invoked anywhere.
- And nearly all of the Discord bots with MAL functionalities, for inspiring me
  to create this bot... as most of bots didn't offer much information about the
  title compared to some (including this), smh.
- *And finally, a honorable mention to PowerShell, because it's literally my*
  *real first scripting language I learned, and because of it, I can create*
  *this bot in python... somehow, cough cough.*
