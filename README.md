<p align="center"> ü§ñ A Title (Anime, Manga, Game, TV, Movie) Lookup and Member
Verificator Bot for Discord, With Privacy in Mind.
    <br>
</p>

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei is a Discord bot that can be used to verify MAL club members
and advanced media title lookup (anime, manga, games, tv, movie) statically
while it keeping simple and easy to use, also respecting users under GDPR,
CCPA/CPRA, and other privacy laws.

The underlying bot frameworks are kinda heavily-typed, so it's might be a bit
resilient to breaking changes, even with 3rd party API wrappers that were
written in-house.

By inviting this bot to your server or using it, you agree to the
[Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) and [Terms of Service](TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md).

> **Warning**
>
> This bot is a rolling release bot, which means that the bot may not be stable
> and may have bugs. If you find any bugs, please report it to GitHub Issues or
> on the support server.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, invite it to your server by pressing this button:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<p align=center><a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=811887256368840744&permissions=274878221376&scope=bot%20applications.commands"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite%20to%20your%20server-5865F2?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white" alt="Shield" height="45"></a></p>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Next, go to the channel you want to use the bot in and type `/` to see the list
of available commands.

All data invoked from `/register` will be stored in
[database.csv](database/database.csv), user is able to delete their data by
using `/unregister` command. Most commands can be used without `/register`
command, although it may limit your experience using it.

If you have any questions, feel free to join the
[support server](https://nttds.my.id/discord) and ask there.

## üöÄ Features <a name = "features"></a>

> This also will be our to-do list for the bot. :3

- [x] MAL account verification (only for self-hosted bot).
- [x] Privacy-friendly: no data is stored on the bot's server, except for the
      user's Discord ID and MAL username. See [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for
      more information.
- [x] Delete your data from the bot's database at any time as you wish using
      `/unregister` command.
- [x] Beautiful embed with thumbnail and footer.
- [x] Simple yet powerful anime, manga, and game lookup.
  - [x] Ability to select search result from multiple results rather than
        automatically selecting the first result. (I'm looking at you, Nadeko)
  - [x] Accurate release date, adapted to your local timezone (based on
        MyAnimeList).
  - [x] External links (MAL, AniList, AniDB, Kitsu, SIMKL, IMDb, TMDB, Trakt,
        and more).
  - [x] A lot of information about the media compared to competitors: synopsis,
        genres and themes, rating with total votes, and more!
  - [x] Know ID of the title you want to search? Use `/relations` command group
        instantly!
- [x] Shows your birthday; including remaining days to your upcoming birthday
      (based on MyAnimeList user profile).
- [x] Customizable Last.fm scrobble summary.
- [x] Export your data in JSON or Python dictionary format.
- [x] Experience the *"true"* randomness result on `/anime random` and
      `/random nekomimi` commands![^1]
- [x] Self-hosting on your phone? No problem! Bot has been tested on Termux on
      Android 11.
- [ ] Does not support dynamic airing reminder. LiveChart + RSS bot is a good
      alternative.
- [ ] Does not support updating your list to MyAnimeList. You can use
      [White Cat](https://whitecat.app) instead.
- [ ] Currently does not support character and cast lookup as it can be really
      complicated if you're using multiple platforms.

[^1]: The random seed was generated using UUID4 and truncated to 32 bits (`pandas` couldn't able to get a sample using a seed above 32 bits unfortunately), and this seed generation happened ***everytime*** user invoked command. I can not guarantee the randomness as it is not the true random as in cryptographically secure random, but it's good enough that you should have hard time to get the same result twice in a row.

## üì£ Available Commands <a name = "commands"></a>

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have installed dependencies installed on your
system:

- Git
- Python (version 3.10 or higher)

You can verify your Python version by running `python --version` or
`python3 --version` in your terminal/command prompt.

Also, you might need Discord account and Discord Bot Token.

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the `ryuuRyuusei` repository by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nattadasu/ryuuRyuusei
   ```

2. Change your current working directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd ryuuRyuusei
   ```

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment to isolate the bot's dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system and shell:

   - **PowerShell**
     - Windows

      ```powershell
      & .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
      ```

     - \*nix

      ```powershell
      & ./venv/bin/activate.ps1
      ```

   - **Command Prompt/Batch**:

     ```batch
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

   - **Bash (\*nix)**:

     ```bash
     source ./venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **Fish (\*nix)**

     ```fish
     source ./venv/bin/activate.fish
     ```

   If you encounter any issues activating the virtual environment, make sure you
   have the appropriate permissions (root access might be required on Unix-like
   systems).

### Installing Dependencies

Before running the bot, you need to install its dependencies. Execute the
following command:

```bash
pip install aiohttp langcodes pyyaml pandas
```

- If you are using Termux on Android, add `MATHLIB="m"` before the `pip`
  command, as there's known issue installing `pandas` dependencies:

  ```bash
  MATHLIB="m" pip install aiohttp langcodes pyyaml pandas
  ```

### Running the Bot

1. Run the initial setup script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python firstRun.py
   ```

   The following script will try to install the required dependencies, updating
   them, initialize database, download additional featured data, converting
   i18n files from YAML to JSON, and copy `.env.example` file as `.env`.

2. If the `.env` file does not exist, follow this step, otherwise skip:

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

3. Fill in the required credentials in the `.env` file.

4. Finally, execute the following command to run the bot:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and launched the Discord bot.

## üéâ Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>

- Karasian, for creating the verification bot for The Newbie Club Discord server
- Lacrima, YubiYuub, and Mental Illness, for helping me with the bot
- [White Cat](https://whitecat.app/), for the ability to link MAL account to
  Discord account and profile can be invoked anywhere.
- And nearly all of the Discord bots with MAL functionalities, for inspiring me
  to create this bot... as most of bots didn't offer much information about the
  title compared to some (including this), smh.
- *And finally, a honorable mention to PowerShell, because it's literally my*
  *real first scripting language I learned, and because of it, I can create*
  *this bot in python... somehow, cough cough.*
