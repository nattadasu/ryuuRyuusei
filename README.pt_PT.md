## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei is a Discord bot that can be used to verify MAL club members and advanced media title lookup (anime, manga, games, tv, movie) statically while it keeping simple and easy to use, also respecting users under GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and other privacy laws.

By inviting this bot to your server or using it, you agree to the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) and [Terms of Service](TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md).

> **Warning**
> 
> This bot is a rolling release bot, which means that the bot may not be stable and may have bugs. If you find any bugs, please report it to GitHub Issues or on the support server.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, invite it to your server using this link:

[![Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite%20to%20your%20server-7289DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=811887256368840744&permissions=274878221376&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Next, go to the channel you want to use the bot in and type `/` to see the list of available commands.

Currently the bot was self-hosted, so it's might not available 24/7, but it get the job done. Although, I'll try to keep it online as much as possible.

All data invoked from `/register` will be stored in [database.csv](database/database.csv), user is able to delete their data by using `/unregister` command. Most commands can be used without `/register` command, although it may limit your experience using it.

If you have any questions, feel free to join the [support server](https://nttds.my.id/discord) and ask there.

## üöÄ Features <a name = "features"></a>

> This also will be our to-do list for the bot. :3

- [x] MAL account verification (only for self-hosted bot).
- [x] Privacy-friendly: no data is stored on the bot's server, except for the user's Discord ID and MAL username. See [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for more information.
- [x] Delete your data from the bot's database at any time as you wish using `/unregister` command.
- [x] Beautiful embed with thumbnail and footer.
- [x] Simple yet powerful anime, manga, and game lookup.

  - [x] Accurate release date, adapted to your local timezone (based on MyAnimeList).
  - [x] External links (MAL, AniList, AniDB, Kitsu, SIMKL, IMDb, TMDB, Trakt, and more).
  - [x] A lot of information about the media compared to competitors: synopsis, genres and themes, rating with total votes, and more!
  - [x] Know ID of the title you want to search? Use `/command info` command instantly!

- [ ] Does not support updating your list to MyAnimeList. You can use [White Cat](https://whitecat.app) instead.
- [ ] Currently does not support character and cast lookup as it can be really complicated if you're using multiple platforms.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `python`, `pip`, and `git`.
- Has a Discord bot token.

### Installing

> Depends on your OS, you may need to use `python3` for the command instead of `python`. You may also need to install packages/modules as superuser/root before continuing to ./firstRun.py

To install Ryuuzaki Ryuusei, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nattadasu/ryuuRyuusei.git
cd ryuuRyuusei
# you may sudo this command if you're on Linux or macOS to avoid permission error
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you need to do an initial setup for the bot. Run `firstRun.py` and let the automation intelligently pick the latest version of installed Python and installs `jikanpy` from GitHub repository (we need APIv4 and AioJikan support), install required modules for the bot, and finally prepare databases (bot, `nattadasu/nekomimiDb`, and AnimeAPI).

```bash
python ./firstRun.py
```

> **Note**
> 
> In some cases, you may need to add variable `PYTHON_BINARY` to skip the automatic Python version detection. For example in PowerShell (Windows/Core), if you have multiple versions of Python installed, you can use
> 
> ```pwsh
> $Env:PYTHON_BINARY = "${Env:LOCALAPPDATA}/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe"
> ```
> 
> to force the script to use Python 3.9.

Then, when `pip` finished installing all of required modules, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required fields.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Note**
> 
> `firstRun.py` already did this for you, but you can do it manually if you want, or if the script unable to do it for you.

Finally, run the bot using `python` command:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

## üéâ Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>

- Karasian, for creating the verification bot for The Newbie Club Discord server
- Lacrima, YubiYuub, and Mental Illness, for helping me with the bot
- [White Cat](https://whitecat.app/), for the ability to link MAL account to Discord account and profile can be invoked anywhere.
- And nearly all of the Discord bots with MAL functionalities, for inspiring me to create this bot... as most of bots didn't offer much information about the title compared to some (including this), smh.
- *And finally, a honorable mention to PowerShell, because it's literally my* *real first scripting language I learned, and because of it, I can create* *this bot in python... somehow, cough cough.*

[^1]: The random seed was generated using UUID4 and truncated to 32 bits (`pandas` couldn't able to get a sample using a seed above 32 bits unfortunately), and this seed generation happened ***everytime*** user invoked command. I can not guarantee the randomness as it is not the true random as in cryptographically secure random, but it's good enough that you should have hard time to get the same result twice in a row.
